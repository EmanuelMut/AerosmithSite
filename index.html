                        <p>Aerosmith is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven
                            Tyler
                            (lead vocals), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad
                            Whitford
                            (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated
                            elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has
                            inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as "the Bad Boys from
                            Boston" and "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band". The primary songwriting
                            team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the "Toxic Twins".
